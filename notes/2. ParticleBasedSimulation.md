## 2.1 Seeing the World Like Seurat
- particle-based approach 
  - scattered particles
  - without any structure,no connect
  - Lagrangian framework
- grid-based approach 
  - digital bitmap image
  - with structure, connect to each other
  - Eule-rian framework


## 2.2 Data Structure

- AOS array of structure
- SOA structure of array


### 2.2.3 Neighbor Search
#### 2.2.3.1 Searching Nearby Particles
Goal: find the nearby particles for a given location
- hash map, convert 3D coordinates to bucket index


### Smoothed Particles

SPH: Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
- smoothed: blurs out the boundaries of the particles
- each particle has its influence radius


### Basics
- interpolation, gradient, Laplacian

#### 2.3.1.1 Kernel

**kernel function**: used to describe the "smoothness"
- the integral of the kernel function is 1
- decay to 0

#### 2.3.1.2 Data Model

#### 2.3.1.3 Interpolation

Measure the any physical quantities

#### Density

compute the densities with updated positions for each time step

#### 2.3.1.5 Differential Operators
